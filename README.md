# Rachel Allen Creative

## Purpose

This is the repo containing everything that I have used to create my sister's personal website. this is the first wesbite that I have created from the very beginning, so it was be a bit more of a process to make sure everything is correctly setup.

### Plugins Used

#### Create-React-App

The main project has been created with create-react-app.

#### React-Spring

I use the Parallax and the ParallaxLayer components for the parallax effect used on the home page. More examples can be found at their website [React Spring Parallax](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/props/parallax).
